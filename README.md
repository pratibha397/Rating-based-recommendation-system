1.This project builds a reliability-aware recommendation system using Amazon product reviews. It combines review helpfulness, recency, and reviewer reputation to score reviews, then uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) 
to identify top reliable reviewers and generate better product insights.

2.Goals of the project
     i.Extract and analyze helpfulness and trustworthiness of reviews.
    ii.Design a composite reliability score from multiple review signals.
  iii.Use matrix factorization (SVD) to recommend top reviewers.
   iv.Evaluate using loss function, mean squared error (MSE), and hit ratio.


3. Key Libraries
pandas – data handling
numpy – numerical operations
scipy.sparse.linalg.svds – sparse SVD
sklearn.metrics – MSE and evaluation

4. Evaluation Metrics
   i.Loss Function: Measures reconstruction loss from SVD.
  ii.MSE (Mean Squared Error): Difference between real and predicted scores.
 iii.Hit Ratio: How accurately the model predicts helpful reviews above a threshold.

5.Future Scope
  i. Integration into Real-Time Recommendation Engines:
       The methodology can be embedded into live e-commerce platforms for dynamic reliability-based product ranking. 
 ii. Temporal Dynamics:
       Incorporating time-series modeling can enhance the analysis by capturing evolving user behavior and product trends. 
iii. Deep Learning for Feature Extraction:
       Neural networks (e.g., autoencoders or transformers) could be applied for more nuanced pattern recognition and better generalization. 
iv.Review Text Analysis:
       Sentiment analysis or NLP-based embedding of review content can complement the numerical helpfulness metrics. 
 v.Cold Start Problem Handling:
      Extend the model to better handle new users or products with no prior interactions by leveraging user or item metadata. 
vi.Robustness to Noisy Feedback:
      Explore methods to detect and down-weight biased or manipulated reviews that might skew reliability scores.
